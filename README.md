**Page 1: The Sun**

* **Picture:** A bright, cartoon-style sun with a smiley face.
* **Paragraph:** "The sun is a giant ball of burning gas in space. It's so hot that it makes its own light, which travels all the way to Earth to give us sunshine! That's how we can see during the day and feel warm."

**Page 2: Fire**

* **Picture:** A friendly campfire with flames that dance and flicker.
* **Paragraph:** "When things burn, they make light and heat.  A campfire is made of wood burning, and the flames give us light to see in the dark and keep us cosy!"

**Page 3: Light Bulbs**

* **Picture:** A traditional light bulb that glows brightly.
* **Paragraph:** "Inside a light bulb is a tiny wire. When you turn on the light, electricity flows through the wire and makes it get so hot that it glows really bright!"

**Page 5: Fireflies**

* **Picture:** A night scene with fireflies twinkling amongst the grass.
* **Paragraph:** "Fireflies are tiny insects that have their own lights inside their bodies. They use their lights to talk to each other and find friends in the dark!"

**Page 6: The Moon**

* **Picture:** A crescent moon shining in the night sky.
* **Paragraph:** "The moon doesn't make its own light. It's like a giant mirror that reflects the light from the sun. That's why it shines at night!"

**Page 7: Stars**

* **Picture:** A dark night sky filled with twinkling stars.
* **Paragraph:** "Stars are like really, really big suns that are very far away. They make their own light, just like our sun, but they look tiny because they're so far away!" 

Page 8: Lightning

Picture: A fork of lightning illuminating the night sky.

Paragraph: "Lightning is a flash of light that happens in the sky during a thunderstorm. It's really, really bright and can make a loud bang! Lightning is made when electricity builds up in clouds and then jumps to the ground or to another cloud."

Page 9: Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)

Picture: A circuit board with rows of colorful LEDs illuminated.
Paragraph: "LEDs are tiny lights that are used in lots of things, like TVs, computers, and even Christmas lights! LEDs are very energy-efficient, which means they use less electricity than other types of lights. They also last for a long time, so you don't have to change them as often."
